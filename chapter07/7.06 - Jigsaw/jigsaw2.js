/*
One possible implementation of the NxN jigsaw puzzle is to use a 2D array to represent the puzzle and a queue to keep track of the unassembled pieces. Each cell in the 2D array will either contain a piece or be null.

Here is the algorithm to solve the puzzle:

Create a 2D array to represent the puzzle, with all cells initially set to null.
Create a queue of unassembled pieces.
Pick a piece from the queue and place it in the top-left cell of the puzzle.
Iterate over the neighbors of the current piece, and for each unassembled neighbor, check if it fits with one of the edges of the current piece using the fitsWith method.
If a fitting piece is found, add it to the puzzle, update the current piece to be the newly placed piece, and add its unassembled neighbors to the queue.
Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the queue is empty or there are no more fitting pieces.
If the puzzle is complete, return it. If not, backtrack to a previous piece and try a different fitting piece.
This algorithm uses a depth-first search approach to assemble the puzzle and backtracks when necessary to try different options. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N^2 * 2^N), where N is the number of puzzle pieces, since each piece has at most 4 edges and each edge can either be assembled or not assembled.
