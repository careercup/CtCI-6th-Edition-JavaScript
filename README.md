# Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition - JavaScript

## Instructions

- This repository contains JavaScript attempts on questions listed in the book.

- So far, code or short writeups are available for the first 10 chapters.

- At Gayle's request, the files only contain code, and do not contain the actual questions. For the questions, please support Gayle by purchasing the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850).

- Under each JavaScript file, there are tests to check that the code is working as expected. For convenience, simple logging is used to test the functions. To run the tests, just cd into the folder containing the .js file and run `node <fileName>.js` to run the tests.

- Contributions welcome
